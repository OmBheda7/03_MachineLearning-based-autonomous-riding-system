The fast-moving progress of applied artificial intelligence (AI) and the predicted importance
of autonomous vehicles on the future, from independent mobility for non-drivers and lowincome individuals, reduced pollution, traffic and parking congestion, increased safety on the
roads, and the ability to create such technologically advanced systems that are self-dependent
in decision making, is the main motivation behind the entire project. Autonomous vehicles
are also predicted to be relied on in some of the most complex human planned endeavors,
such as space exploration. The meteoric rise of AI along with deep learning (DL) methods and frameworks, have made possible the creation of such an autonomous vehicle without
expensive laboratories and years of research.
The system that we have proposed is to built a self-driving car that is scaled-down to the size
of an RC Car. Along with learning the new technologies and exploring this domain, goals
from the project is to build a model capable of navigating through the map autonomously,
while demonstrating the capability to perform behaviors such as lane following, dynamic
actions with respect to environment changes. The project goes through the entire process of
building such a vehicle, starting from the RC car model and the embedded hardware platform, to the orchestration end-to-end machine learning algorithms and a user application.
